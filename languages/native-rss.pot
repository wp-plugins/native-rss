msgid ""
"This plugin will change the language tag of the blogfeeds from \"en\" to the "
"native language of your WP-installation by default. You can however, change "
"the feed-language in the settings, e.g. if your blog is running in french, "
"but you publish in dutch. Nothing specific will change in the feed but your "
"blog will be found easier by people using the language, you are actually "
"writing in. Also it helps search engines to list your site correcly, if you "
"provide the feed as a sitemap."
